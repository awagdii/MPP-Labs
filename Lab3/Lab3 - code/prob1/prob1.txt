a. Because "p2" is an instance of "Person" not an instance of "PersonWithJob", 
So in the equals() function of PersonWithJob will return false when judge if the parameter is an instance of PersonWithJob.
PersonWithJob is inheritance from Person, so "p1" is also an instance of "Person". It will return true as expected.
