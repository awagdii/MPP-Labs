NO we shouldn't use inheritence here and below is the clarification :

Same as the current package implementation: the Cylinder-Circle Problem :
package :  inheritance.Test1
the problem here is the circle can access computeVolumn of the Parent Cylinder
Object which is not related to the circle behaviour,
composition solved the problem by having the right structure
to compute the volume of the cylinder meanwhile the circle cannot access this method by itself
Please check Package : Compostion.Test2
